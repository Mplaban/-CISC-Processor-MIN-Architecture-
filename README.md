# -CISC-Processor-MIN-Architecture-
-The project aimed to design a CISC processor with a given MIN Architecture (Custom Architecture) with a given set of instructions (ADD,
SUB, BRANCH, LOAD & STORE) with three addressing modes: Register direct, Memory to Register, and Memory to Memory.

-Hardware Flowchart method was used. The modules designed were Instruction Decoder, Execution Unit, Control Word Store, and Next
State Logic.

-Write a testbench program code to test the execution of the processor using Verilog Code.

-The software used for the project was Questa-Sim.
